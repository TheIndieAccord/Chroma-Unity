Chroma is a powerful color changing ecosystem designed and maintained by Razer. This Chroma module is built to be used within Unity by accesssing Razer's Chroma C++ Library through Colore's Chroma C# Wrapper.
TIA's Chroma Module has support for theoretically infinite layers, although only three active layers has been tested.
